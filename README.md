This page contains the software used in the open hardware smartphone (libresmartphone) and other projects files and documentation that can be useful to develop it. In the future it will have the mechanical (Freecad) and Electronical (Kicad) designs to make it. Visit http://libresmartphone.com and https://hackaday.io/project/6310-libresmartphone for more information.

# Objective

Libresmartphone is a smartphone that can be connected to a bigger screen and be used as a desktop computer to edit documents, watch videos, listen to music, edit images, videos and much more.

When it is finished it will have a 6 inch screen, hdmi output, cameras, bluetooth, wifi, GPS, 4G or better and GSM. It will also have two or more microusb that will allow you to connect your printer and other gadgets/peripherials.

It will be open software and open hardware, designed with free software (Kicad) to let other users study, change and improve the software and the hardware.

If you are concerned by the mass surveillance the goverment makes you will be able to modify the smartphone to put hardware kill switches to the camera, GPS, 4G, GSM... easily.

# Roadmap 

# *1) Make a raspberry pi prototype work as desired (Estimated time: 3 months – 1 year)(Estimated cost: <500€):*

· Software to make calls, send/receive SMS (with the adafruit 3G Fona or similar), import contacts (csv) and take photos in any GNU/linux or BSD OS.

· GPS navigation with navit.

· Easy to make case (MDF) / CAD files to 3d print the case.

· 7'' capacitive screen from the raspberry pi foundation.

Make a manual so every user with a raspberry pi can achieve a working prototype easily.

*The raspberry pi prototype will be made to have a bigger user base for the project, currently there are 8 million raspberry pi in the market and a lot of their users are DIY enthusiats. Many of them are not willing to pay for an open source smartphone but would love to make calls with the raspberry, send SMS for their projects, make an easy to make GPS for their car, etc. *

# *2) Make a prototype with the components more open (Estimated time: 6 months – 4 years)(Estimated cost: 500-40.000€):*

· Use a more open HW board (A64 OLinuXino or similar) instead of the raspberry pi.

· Use a more open HW screen (Manga Screen or similar) or design a 6'' capacitive screen if there isn't any open hardware one available at that time (try to make a crowdfunding campaing to let others interested contribute).

· Use a more open HW modem breakout if there is one available instead of the Adafruit 3G or design a LTE (PLS8-E) or better modem breakout (try to make a crowdfunding campaing to let others interested contribute).

*The prototype with separate parts will be made to replace them if better / smaller alternatives appear in the market.*

*If there aren't suitable screens or modem breakout a crowdfunding campaing will be made. The reason to make it that way is because there are other people that could want this parts for a different project and help to make it possible faster. Even if there is not enough people willing to support a crowdfunding campaing, the current people interested in making libresmartphone are able to pay Elias Bakken, Nikolaus Schaller or others to make them.*

*When the prototype has the size and requirements desired libresmartphone development will start part 3.*

# *3) Libresmartphone final design (Estimated time: <2 years)(Estimated cost: 50.000-200.000€).*

·Design a pcb that has the CPU, GPU, RAM, modem, WiFi, etc in the same board taking in consideration all the designs used in part 2 of the development.

·Design a case to fit all the components inside that is easy to 3d print. If there are enough people interested an injection case could be made.
